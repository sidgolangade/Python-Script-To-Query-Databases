## System Resource Monitor Script
This Python script connects to an AWS EC2 RHEL instance and retrieves system resource information using the `top` command. It then sorts the output based on CPU usage and displays the top 5 processes along with their %CPU, %MEM, COMMAND, USER, and PID.

### Prerequisites
- An AWS EC2 instance running RHEL
- Python 3.x installed on the local machine
- Required Python packages: `paramiko`

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the `paramiko` package by running `pip install paramiko` in your terminal.
3. Update the `hostname`, `username`, `private_key_path`, and `output_file` variables in the script with the appropriate values.
4. Run the script using the command `python system_resource_monitor.py`.
5. The script will connect to the EC2 instance, retrieve the system resource information, sort and display the top 5 processes, and save the sorted output to the specified output file.

### Output
The script will display the sorted output to the console with the following information for each process:
- CPU Usage (%)
- Memory Usage (%)
- Command
- User
- PID

Additionally, the sorted output will be saved to a text file specified by the `output_file` variable.

**Note:** This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions and access credentials to connect to the AWS EC2 RHEL instance.
